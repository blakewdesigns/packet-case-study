                <article>
                    <p>Lack of true human connection is a growing issue in our time. The internet and social media have secluded us in our own worlds. Packet is the solution to this problem. We do this by combining location services, interest matching, and contact information to encourage interaction and connection in the real world. <br> It's your resume for friendship!</p>

                <h3>Context and Challenges</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>How do I change this ingrained mindset? Why do younger individuals prefer to connect through social media, sometimes sight unseen? These are questions that had to be answered when designing the interactivity and accessibility of Packet.<br>These questions crafted my goal. I needed to create a hybrid experience. A combination of real-life interaction and the social media people are already using. This led tothe conclusion that I needed to find a way to remove the social barrier. Take away the awkward initial interaction and things will flow more freely.</p>
                </article>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>The biggest hurdle was crafting a solution that caters to the original intention of the app, as well as unintended ways to interact that users would discover. The original concept consisted of meeting a new person in real life, cahtting with them, and then exchanging Packets to keep in touch. Feedback and further interviews proved that users were also interested in previewing and preemptively sending their Packet before talking with the person in real life. The solution began to take shape.<br>I have created a home screen that caters to both interactions. It displays a radar containing other users in your immediate area. The radar also shows how many interests you have in common with them. This allows users to find others at a glance. You also have the option to see a condensed preview of others' profiles on the radar before sending your own Packet. The combination of proximity, interest matching, and the ability to instantly share all of your social media accounts and contact information makes Packet a viable solution to this growing problem.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Testing the app yielded some interesting results. Users easily navigated the application, and even knew how to access certain areas without any exposition. Initial issues discovered in this phase include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Too many words on the main screens.</li>
                            <li>Center the primary user on the home screen.</li>
                            <li>Previous connections page is difficult to understand.</li>
                            <li>Removal of excessive social features.</li>
                            <li>Onboarding screens need to do a better job of explaining the intention of the application.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>All of these suggestions were taken to heart when crafting the final iteration of Packet.</p>

                <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>The visuals of Packet went through many iterations. The final color palette is intended to be inviting and very simple. The goal is to foster a welcoming experience.<br> There are five primary loops within Packet.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sending a Packet</li>
                            <li>Receiving a Packet</li>
                            <li>Exchanging Packets</li>
                            <li>Viewing Previous Connections</li>
                            <li>Viewing and editing your own Packet</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>Sending, receiving, and exchanging are very similar processes contained within simple overlays on the home screen. There are accompanying animations for each action to show the user the action is actively taking place. Taking the user to a different screen for each action proved to be very tedious and distracting.<br>Users have complete control over what information is displayed on their Packet preview on other users' radar screens. They also have the ability to toggle off certain information in their Packet when sharing with specific connections.<br>There is also a 'Hide from Radar' function in addition to a 'Reject and Block' feature to prevent Packet spamming.<br> Once a connection is made, a link will form between the two users on the radar screen. This is visible to anyone in your area. This is to provide additional context into existing relationships and connections in your area.</p>

                <h3>Final Results</h3>
                <article> 
                    <p>The final version of Packet has a solution for every pain point I originally intended to solve. Users can install Packet, set up their own personal Packet profile, and start connecting in a few short minutes. Say goodbye to missed connections.<br>Packet is the answer to the stagnated social mindset of the modern user. It is here to assist anti-social users with making friends in the real world, and the social user with a thoughtlessly easyway to connect on the fly. It can be used for organized meet-ups, professional networking, dating, or just meeting new people.</p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>Throughout this project, I learned how different types of people approach social interaction. It was interesting to see some users interact with the prototype in ways that I had not even imagined. This led to the implementation of new features and tweaks to existing features. I essentially fulfilled the creed of UX design. User-centered design is the only way to make a truly successful product.<br>I learned a lot about the implementation of color as well. Swapping out the dark palette for a light theme and bold accents made the app instantly more appealing. The new color scheme really conveys the tone of the intended interaction.<br>The imporatance of good typography is something else I have taken away from this project. My original choice would have seen all the text in the app upper case. This was too distracting for the user and didn't help when trying to separate things visually.<br>Overall, this project was the perfect experience for me. I was able to implement everything I have learned about UX design. I feel successful in my efforts and passionate about the final product.</p>
